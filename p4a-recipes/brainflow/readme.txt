this file is compiled on my android tablet (arm64), because even though brainflow 
compiles on github workflows i couldnt get it to compile it for my tablets architecture.

but after i compiled it and packaged it and uploaded it to github it can now be installed with

pip install 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windwerfer/compile_kivy_and_brainflow_github_for_arm64_sample/main/p4a-recipes/brainflow/brainflow-5.7.0.tar.gz'
