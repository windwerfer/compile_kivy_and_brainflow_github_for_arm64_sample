# compile_kivy_with_github_sample

very simple kivy app, compiled through github

only usable as an example. i made it public, because i overreached my storage quota.

nothing to hide, but this is just for testing..

- compiles, uses python 3.9 in buildozer, python 3.10 as host (the python from the ubuntu virt mashine)
- brainflow is compiled on my home system (android with python 3.10) so importing it in the app crashes the app
- couldnt make buildozer use python3==3.10.9 ,hostpython3==3.10.9 (in reqirements settin in buildozer.spec).. just doesnt compile..
